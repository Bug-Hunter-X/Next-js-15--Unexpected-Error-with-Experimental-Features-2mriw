# Next.js 15 Unexpected Error with Experimental Features

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Next.js 15's experimental features (like the `app` directory) incorrectly.  The original code might exhibit unexpected behavior or throw error messages that aren't immediately clear.

## Problem
The main problem stems from using experimental Next.js features without the proper setup or configuration. This can lead to various errors, including runtime errors and build-time errors that are difficult to debug.

## Solution
The solution involves verifying your Next.js configuration (package.json, next.config.js, etc.) to ensure it correctly supports the experimental features used in your application.  Double-check the usage of `app` directory, API routes, and other related features for correct syntax and implementation.  Updating Next.js to the latest version might also resolve compatibility issues.

## How to reproduce the bug
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the app: `npm run dev` (observe the errors)

## How to fix the bug
Refer to the provided `bugSolution.js` file for a potential correction.  The key is ensuring the project setup is aligned with the used experimental features.
